This code is a program that simulates quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. 
QKD is one of the key techniques in quantum cryptography where two parties share secure encryption keys, and this simulation models the process by which Alice and Bob use quantum bits (qubits) to exchange keys. 
It also includes detecting an eavesdropper named Eve and correcting the error. 
In this simulation, we include error prediction using Kalman filters, error correction techniques, privacy amplification methods, and visualization of results using ratatui.
